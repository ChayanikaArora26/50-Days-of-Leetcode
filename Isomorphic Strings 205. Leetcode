Question:
205. Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "f11", t = "b23"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as '1' needs to be mapped to both '2' and '3'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.


Solution:

class Solution(object):
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        s_to_t = {}
        t_to_s = {}

        for cs, ct in zip(s, t):
            if cs in s_to_t:
                if s_to_t[cs] != ct:
                    return False
            else:
                s_to_t[cs] = ct

            if ct in t_to_s:
                if t_to_s[ct] != cs:
                    return False
            else:
                t_to_s[ct] = cs

        return True

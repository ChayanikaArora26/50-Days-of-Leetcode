Hint
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.



Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):  # Ensure we don’t use the same element twice
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]


MY EXPLANATION:

We already have the function and class built, we added 2 for loops i and j to go through the array and the next element. Once we find that the sum of the ith+jth element is taregt value we end the loop, otherwise we keep incrementing the value of i and j till we find target value. We print the index of i and j as output
